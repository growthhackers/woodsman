# Note: The cmd option is now required due to the increasing number of ways
#       rspec may be run, below are examples of the most common uses.
#  * bundler: 'bundle exec rspec'
#  * bundler binstubs: 'bin/rspec'
#  * spring: 'bin/rspec' (This will use spring if running and you have
#                          installed the spring binstubs per the docs)
#  * zeus: 'zeus rspec' (requires the server to be started separately)
#  * 'just' rspec: 'rspec'

guard :rspec, cmd: 'rspec' do
  watch('spec/spec_helper.rb')                        { 'spec' }
  watch(%r{^spec/.+_spec\.rb$})
  watch(%r{^app/(.+)\.rb$})                           { 'spec' }
  watch(%r{^lib/(.+)\.rb$})                           { 'spec' }
